# Events

An event is something that happened which may result in a state change. In a saga state machine, an event is used to correlate a message to a saga state
machine instance. Saga state machine events are used to add behavior to a saga state machine, such as adding or updating saga state machine instance data,
publishing or sending messages, and changing the instance's current state.

## Declaring Events

Events are declared as _public_ properties on the saga state machine with the `Event<T>` property type, where `T` is a valid message type.

In the example below, the _SubmitOrder_ message is configured as an event. The event configuration also specifies the message property used to correlate the
event to a saga state machine instance. In this case, the `Guid` property `OrderId` is used.

```csharp
public record SubmitOrder(Guid OrderId);

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(() => SubmitOrder,
            e => e.CorrelateById(x => x.Message.OrderId)
        );
    }
}
```

### Event Conventions

There are several conventions applied when configuring event correlation in a saga state machine. These conventions may reduce the amount of configuration
required for an event meeting a convention's criteria.

#### CorrelatedBy<Guid>

If an event message type implements the `CorrelatedBy<Guid>` interface, the event will automatically be configured to correlate using the `CorrelationId`
property on that interface.

#### Property Name

If an event message has a `CorrelationId`, `CommandId`, or `EventId` property and that properties type is `Guid`, the event will automatically be configured
to correlate using the first property found (in that order).

#### Global Topology

It's also possible to configure the correlation property for a message type using `GlobalTopology`. This configures the message type globally so that it is
automatically available to any saga state machine. However, a saga state machine can override the global settings by explicitly configuring the event
correlation.

```csharp
GlobalTopology.Send.UseCorrelationId<SubmitOrder>(x => x.OrderId);
```

## Initiating Events

The `Initial` state is the starting point of all sagas. When an existing saga state machine instance cannot be found that correlates to an event behavior
defined for the _Initial_ state, a new instance is created.

Events handled in the _Initial_ state are _initiating events_ that result in a newly created saga state machine instance is an instance does not already
exist.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;

    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(SubmitOrder)
                .Then(context => 
                {
                    context.Saga.CustomerNumber = context.Message.CustomerNumber;
                })
                .TransitionTo(Submitted)
        );
    }
}
```

## Handling Events

Event can be handled in any _state_, and can be configured using `During` and specifying the states in which the event is accepted. In the example below,
the `AcceptOrder` event is handled in the `Submitted` state.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;
    public State Accepted { get; private set; } = null!;

    public Event<AcceptOrder> AcceptOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        During(Submitted,
            When(AcceptOrder)
                .Then(context => 
                {
                    context.Saga.AcceptedAt = context.SentTime ?? DateTime.UtcNow;
                })
                .TransitionTo(Accepted)
        );
    }
}
```

Multiple states can be specified using `During` to avoid duplicating behavior configuration. In the updated example below, the `AcceptOrder` event is also
handled in the `Accepted` state, to add some idempotency to the saga state machine.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;
    public State Accepted { get; private set; } = null!;

    public Event<AcceptOrder> AcceptOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        During(Submitted, Accepted,
            When(AcceptOrder)
                .Then(context => 
                {
                    context.Saga.AcceptedAt ??= context.SentTime ?? DateTime.UtcNow;
                })
                .TransitionTo(Accepted)
        );
    }
}
```

## Advanced Options

Like most things in MassTransit, the everyday use case of MassTransit should not need to use these options. But sometimes, you have to really dig in to make
things happen.

### Setting the Saga Factory

::alert{type="warning"}
The only time is when using `InsertOnInitial` and you have required properties that must be present or the insert will fail. Typically with SQL and not null
columns.
::

On events that are in the `Initial` state, a new instance of the saga will be created. You can use the `SetSagaFactory` to control how the saga is instantiated.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(
            () => SubmitOrder, 
            e => 
            {
                e.CorrelateById(cxt => cxt.Message.OrderId)
                e.SetSagaFactory(cxt =>
                {
                    // complex constructor logic
                    return new OrderState 
                    {
                        CorrelationId = cxt.Message.OrderId 
                    };
                });
            }
            
        );
    }
}
```
